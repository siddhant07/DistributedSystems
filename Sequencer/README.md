STEPS TO EXECUTE SEQUENCER:

1. Decide the number of servers you want and set the value of the 'process_count' variable to that in config.py
2. Run the Sequencer.py
3. Now you can run client.py
4. As the console mentions, type 'get' and hit enter to trigger the 'get_id" function which will return an id for you.
5. At the end, type 'quit' to close the client
