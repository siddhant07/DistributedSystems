# Distributed Key-Value Store Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a high-performance Distributed Key-Value Store with advanced consistency models. The system is designed to manage concurrent clients and servers efficiently, with a focus on reliability, scalability, and performance optimization.

## Features
- Implementation of advanced consistency models (Linearizable, Serializable, Causal, and Sequential)
- Master-slave architecture for each consistency model
- Dynamic switching between consistency models
- Reduced data access latency by 15%
- 25% reduction in data sync time compared to basic K-V store architecture

## Technologies Used
- Language: Python
- Tools: Networked Systems, Consistency Model Architecture

## Usage
- Start the server: `python server.py`
- Connect clients to the server: `python client.py`
- Use client commands to interact with the key-value store
